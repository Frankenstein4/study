  "readme": "# Express Autoroute\nThis helper library has come about after about a year of slowly improving how we structure our NodeJS apps at Blooie and ultimately me being fed up of having to continuously type out ```app.get('/blah', blah_handler)``` and wondering where different paths are being constructed. \n\nI also subscribe to the idea of [convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) because we developers have enough to think about. Also for something like NodeJS where there are so many people trying it out for the first time and fewer people blogging about best practices, sometimes its better to just follow convention and learn good ways to structure your app and write re-usable code. \n\n## Installation\n```js\nnpm install express-autoroute\n```\n\n## Usage\nFirst things first you need to enable the autorouter and pass it your express app. \n\n```js\nvar autoroute = require('express-autoroute');\nautoroute(app); //where app is an express app\n```\n\nFor express-autoroute to start working you need to have a ```routes/``` folder that contains specially formatted javascript files that expose an autoroute object that contains the public route api. The best way to describe it is with an example. \n\nThis is the contents of a file  ```routes/blacklists.js```. Note that the name of the file has nothing to do with the resulting endpoint so you can structure your files however you like.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports.autoroute = {\n\tget: {\n\t\t'/blacklists' : get_all,\n\t\t'/blacklists/:id' : get\n\t},\n\tpost: {\n\t\t'/blacklists/:id' : update,\n\t\t'/blacklists' : create\n\t},\n\tdelete: {\n\t\t'/blacklists/:id' : del\n\t}\n};\n\nfunction get_all(req, res){\n\t//do something\n}\n\n...\n```\nAs you can see the file is exposing a structured object. This object will be used later to decide what endpoints to create for the express application and will ultimately result in the following commands being executed\n\n```js\napp.get('/blacklists/', get_all);\napp.get('/blacklists/:id', get_all);\napp.post('/blacklists/:id', update);\napp.post('/blacklists', create);\napp.detete('/blacklists/:id' : del);\n```\n\nAnd thats it! A nicely declarative way to load your routes. \n\n### Folders\nexpress-autoroute also supports routes being separated into folders. The folder name will be added as a prefix to the express endpoints. For example, if you use the same ```blacklists.js``` file from before but move it to the folder ```routes/api/blacklists.js``` the resulting express commands will look like this\n\n```js \napp.get('/api/blacklists/', get_all);\napp.get('/api/blacklists/:id', get_all);\napp.post('/api/blacklists/:id', update);\napp.post('/api/blacklists', create);\napp.detete('/api/blacklists/:id' : del);\n```\n\n### Middelwares\nA nifty feature in express is the ability to have route specific middlewares, and if they are used correctly they can really reduce the amount of code you write and always keep things DRY. express-autoroute supports the use of route middlewares by just adding an array to the autoroute object. Here is a silly little example but at least it explains the idea: \n\n```js \nmodule.exports.autoroute = {\n\tget: {\n\t\t'/blacklists' : [authentication, get_all]\n\t}\n};\n\nfunction get_all(req, res){\n\t//use the user object to get something\n\tvar myBlacklists = db.getMyBlacklists(req.user.id)\n\tres.send(myBlacklists);\n}\n\nfunction authentication(req, res, next){\n\t//get the user object or whatever \n\treq.user = dbUser;\n\tnext();\n}\n```\n\n# Licence\nCopyright (c) 2013, Andrew Manson <andrew@bloo.ie>, Blooie Limited <info@bloo.ie>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
